A harmless joke VBS script to help you ask the question (if you want to use it seriously) and is really annoying to the user if they say no.

What it does in short

- Appears as a fake corrupted system message
- Redirects to a Rick Roll if you choose No or can be uncommented to redirect to `YouAreAnIdiot`

Rename `be-my-valentine.vbs` to something more subtle if you want. To completely change the icon, 
create a shortcut to the .vbs file then change the icon and hide the original file.

**Disclaimer**: If you end up running the `YouAreAnIdiot` section (commented out by default), restart your PC to stop it.

**Flash Warning**: `YouAreAnIdiot` flashes extremely fast. Do not use it if you are sensitive to loud noises and flashing images.
